# Installation of Node.js (Step by Step)

## What is Node.js?
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine. It allows you to run JavaScript code outside the browser, making it ideal for server-side applications.

## Steps to Install Node.js

1. **Download Node.js:**
   - Visit the official website: [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).
   - Download the **LTS (Long-Term Support)** version for better stability.

2. **Install Node.js:**
   - Run the installer you downloaded.
   - Accept the terms of use.
   - Set the installation directory (usually the default one is fine).
   - Check the option to install npm along with Node.js.

3. **Verify the Installation:**
   - Open a terminal.
   - Type `node -v` to check the Node.js version.
   - Type `npm -v` to check the npm version.

4. **Optional: Install Additional Tools:**
   - You can install **nvm (Node Version Manager)** to manage multiple versions of Node.js.
